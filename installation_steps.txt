Precautions:

    All terminals will be closed when the code is running, so do not run the program in the terminal (it can be run in PyCharm), 
    and other running programs should also be closed first;
    The program environment depends on environment.yaml;

    Write your reinforcement learning program in /CarND-test/src/train/train.py, pay attention to modify your file storage 
    location in lines 151, 181, etc. In addition, lines 183 and 185 in the program simulate mouse clicks to open the simulation 
    different monitors may need to modify the mouse position;

    Compile the program according to the prompts in /CarND-test/README.md, understand the role of /CarND-test/src/main.cpp 
    (may need to be adjusted accordingly);

    Different computers may have different version configurations of tensorflow-gpu, cuda, cudnn, and keras, please install 
    them yourself;

    To test whether the simulation environment is successfully installed, you can 
    run decision-making-CarND/term3_sim_linux/term3_sim.x86_64 and decision-making-CarND/CarND-test/src/test/path_planning;

    The program uses C++ and Python to exchange information through the socket. You need to enable Python monitoring first, 
    otherwise, running path_planning directly will display a connect error error;

    The version and method of tensorflow and keras used in the sample program are relatively old. If configuration is 
    difficult, you can freely choose the method of network construction (such as pytorch, etc.), as long as Python can 
    normally monitor data through the socket.


Environment configuration steps:

    git clone https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/Autonomous-Driving.git

    cd Autonomous-Driving/decision-making-CarND/term3_sim_linux

    sudo chmod u+x term3_sim.x86_64

    Make sure cmake >= 3.5, make >= 4.1, gcc/g++ >= 5.4 (generally installed, refer to decision-making-CarND/CarND-test/README.md 
    if not installed)

    Enter the decision-making-CarND/CarND-test folder, run install-ubuntu.sh to install dependencies (bash install-ubuntu.sh)

    Run .build/path_planning and it shows that the connect error is normal
    
    Install anaconda3 or miniconda3

    Modify the last line in environment.yaml to your conda installation location, run conda env create -f environment.yaml 
    to create a virtual environment
    
    Write the decision-making-CarND/CarND-test/src/train/train.py file and run it, the precautions are as above
